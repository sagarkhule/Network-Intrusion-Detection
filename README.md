# Network-Intrusion-Detection
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for intrusion detection using the KDD Cup 1999 dataset. The KDD Cup 1999 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection. The dataset consists of a large number of network traffic records, including both normal and various types of malicious activities.
